'''
Lab 13: My first AI agent.
In this lab, you will create your first AI agent.
You will use the run_episode function from lab 12 to run a number of episodes
and collect the returns for each state-action pair.
Then you will use the returns to calculate the action values for each state-action pair.
Finally, you will use the action values to calculate the optimal policy.
You will then test the optimal policy to see how well it performs.

Sidebar-
If you reward every action you may end up in a situation where the agent
will always choose the action that gives the highest reward. Ironically,
this may lead to the agent losing the game.
