# Lab 11: Project Handoff
You may now consider creating a fork of your respository to work on the project. 


## Lab Task 1: Create a Class Diagram of the lab11 folder
Consider each file a package for the UML diagram.
Submit the class diagram by the end of the lab session to assignment 'Lab 11: Project Handoff (Task 2)'.

## Lab Task 2: Complete the pygame_ai_player.py file
Complete the pygame_ai_player.py file with the two classes scaffolded out for you.
Make sure that the game runs through the agent_environment.py file fully autonomously.
You can just use some hard coded actions for the agent to take at this point. 
Submit the code by the end of the week to assignment 'Lab 11: Project Handoff (Task 1)'.
