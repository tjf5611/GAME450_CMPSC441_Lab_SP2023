# Lab 11: Project Handoff
You may now consider creating a branch of your respository to work on the project. 


## Lab Task 1: Create a Class Diagram of the lab11 folder
Consider each file a package for the UML diagram.
Submit the class diagram by the end of the lab session to assignment 'Lab 11: Project Handoff (Task 2)'.

## Lab Task 2: Complete the pygame_ai_player.py file
Complete the pygame_ai_player.py file with the two classes scaffolded out for you.
Make sure that the game runs through the agent_environment.py file fully autonomously.
You can just use some hard coded actions for the agent to take at this point. 
Submit the code by the end of the week to assignment 'Lab 11: Project Handoff (Task 1)'.

> Code created in this lab was created with help from ChatGPT. \n
> The prompt used was:
>     Create a code to move a sprite across a pygame window with a given start location and end location with a constant speed. 
> The response was:
```

# Set up the window

        running = False

    # Draw the sprite and the background
    window.fill((255, 255, 255)) # white background
    window.blit(sprite, sprite_pos)

    # Update the display and tick the clock
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(60) # limit to 60 frames per second

# Quit Pygame
pygame.quit()
